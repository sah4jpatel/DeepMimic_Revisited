# DeepMimic with MuJoCo and Gym

## Overview

This repository presents a reimplementation of the DeepMimic control framework using MuJoCo and Gym. Our new approach aims to create a flexible, accessible platform for imitation learningâ€”ranging from simple Behaviour Cloning to advanced DeepMimic methodsâ€”while supporting parallel training and architecture experimentation. Weâ€™re also broadening our dataset support by transitioning from the perfectly formatted Loco_MuJoCo dataset to incorporating CMU's Mocap dataset, enabling more diverse and realistic motion capture inputs.

## Original DeepMimic Implementation

### Technical Backbone

- **Custom C++ Simulation:**  
  The original DeepMimic repo featured a custom-built C++ simulation and visualization environment. This engine was designed to simulate high-dimensional character dynamics and integrate motion capture data into a physics-based control policy.

- **Dataset and Data Formatting:**  
  The dataset consisted of high-dimensional states (positions, orientations, joint angles, velocities, and phase variables) with corresponding actions (target joint configurations or torques), maintaining a strict 1:1 mapping between inputs and outputs for realistic imitation.

- **Learning Pipeline:**  
  The original system employed a combination of imitation learning and later reinforcement learning, with loss functions tuned to capture multiple aspects of motion fidelity.

### Challenges

- **Complexity:**  
  The powerful, custom C++ environment proved challenging to extend and modify, slowing rapid prototyping and experimentation.

- **Accessibility:**  
  The custom tools and visualization systems limited contributions and hindered flexible experimentation with alternative datasets or learning strategies.

## Our Implementation: DeepMimic with MuJoCo and Gym

### The Proposed Plan

1. **MuJoCo-based Physics Simulation:**  
   We now use MuJoCo for its robust and reliable physics simulation, combined with the Gym environment for a standardized interface. This setup supports both simple imitation learning and the more complex DeepMimic approach.

2. **Dataset Flexibility:**  
   Our experiments began with the Loco_MuJoCo dataset to build familiarity through Behaviour Cloning. Moving forward, we plan to integrate CMU's Mocap dataset to offer more varied and realistic motion capture data, overcoming the limitations of a perfectly formatted dataset.

3. **Training Pipeline in PyTorch:**  
   The control policy is implemented in PyTorch. We support both a Behaviour Cloning pipelineâ€”where initial results have been impressive (as demonstrated by our gif)â€”and a full DeepMimic imitation learning approach, which is in early stages and undergoing refinement.

4. **Parallel Training and Architecture Exploration:**  
   The implementation is designed to support parallel training, accelerating experimentation. Weâ€™re also exploring modifications to the model architecture to improve performance and better capture complex character dynamics.

5. **Modular and Configurable Design:**  
   Hyperparameters, including training epochs, learning rate, simulation steps, and model dimensions, are fully configurable via `config.yaml`, ensuring that our system remains flexible and easy to extend.

6. **Simulation and Evaluation:**  
   The simulation module (`simulate.py`), now integrated with MuJoCo and Gym (see `mujoco_env.py`), renders high-fidelity simulations that allow for thorough evaluation of our trained models.

## Current Status and Future Work

- **Behaviour Cloning:**  
  We have achieved strong results with our Behaviour Cloning approach, and a demonstration gif is included in the repository to showcase these achievements.

- **DeepMimic Implementation:**  
  Our initial DeepMimic results are preliminary and not yet on par with our Behaviour Cloning performance. Ongoing work is focused on refining these results by:
  - Optimizing the training pipeline,
  - Testing novel model architectures,
  - Enhancing parallel training strategies, and
  - Integrating the CMU Mocap dataset for richer motion data.
