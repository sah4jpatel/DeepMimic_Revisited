# DeepMimic with IsaacGym

## Overview

This repository presents a modern reimplementation of the DeepMimic control framework using PyTorch and NVIDIA's IsaacGym as the simulation backend. By leveraging IsaacGym, we can run GPU-accelerated physics simulations, significantly speeding up the training and evaluation of our control policies.

Our goal is to reproduce the architecture and core ideas of DeepMimicâ€”using expert motion capture data to train a control policyâ€”while replacing the original C++ simulation and the alterniatve Mujoco implementation with a GPU-based physics simulator.

## Original DeepMimic Implementation

### Technical Backbone

- **Custom C++ Simulation:**  
  The original DeepMimic repo featured a custom-built C++ simulation and visualization environment. This engine was designed to simulate high-dimensional character dynamics, integrating motion capture data into a physics-based control policy.

- **Dataset and Data Formatting:**  
  The dataset consists of high-dimensional states (including positions, orientations, joint angles, velocities, and phase variables) and corresponding actions (target joint configurations or torques). This strict 1:1 mapping between data inputs and simulation outputs was essential for achieving realistic imitation.

- **Learning Pipeline:**  
  The system used a combination of imitation learning (and later reinforcement learning) to train the control policy, employing loss functions that accounted for multiple aspects of motion fidelity.

### Challenges

- **Complexity:**  
  The original C++ environment was powerful but complex and difficult to extend, especially for rapid prototyping.
  
- **Accessibility:**  
  The custom tools and visualization systems posed a barrier to new contributors and limited experimentation.

## Our Implementation: DeepMimic with IsaacGym

### The Proposed Plan

1. **Leveraging GPU-Based Physics with IsaacGym:**  
   Instead of a custom C++ simulation or Mujoco, we use IsaacGym to run physics simulations entirely on the GPU. IsaacGymâ€™s Python API lets us simulate complex character dynamics with high performance and scalability.

2. **Dataset Compatibility:**  
   We will use the same dataset as the original DeepMimic, formatted identically. A dedicated `data_loader.py` module is provided to parse and prepare the data, ensuring a 1:1 mapping between the original inputs/outputs and our simulation environment.

3. **Training Pipeline in PyTorch:**  
   The control policy is implemented in PyTorch, mapping high-dimensional state inputs (as defined in the dataset) to action outputs. The training pipeline uses imitation learning to reproduce the expert motions.

4. **Modular and Configurable Design:**  
   Hyperparameters (such as training epochs, learning rate, simulation steps, and model dimensions) are configurable via `config.yaml`, ensuring that our implementation is flexible and easy to extend.

5. **Simulation and Evaluation:**  
   The simulation module (`simulate.py`), now integrated with IsaacGym (see `isaac_env.py`), runs the trained model, rendering high-fidelity simulations using GPU-accelerated physics.

### Our Advantages

- **High-Performance Simulation:**  
  With IsaacGym, we harness the power of GPU-based physics simulation, making training faster and enabling real-time simulation of complex dynamics.

- **Ease of Use and Extension:**  
  By using a modern Python-based framework and a well-supported simulator, our implementation is more accessible and easier to modify than the original C++ codebase.

- **Reproducibility and Collaboration:**  
  The repository is structured to make it easy for new contributors to understand the technical backbone of DeepMimic and the improvements weâ€™ve introduced using IsaacGym.
